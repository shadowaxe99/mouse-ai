I'm sorry for the confusion, but .h5 files are binary files used to store the weights of a trained machine learning model, such as those created with TensorFlow. They don't contain human-readable code, so I can't provide the code for this file. However, I can provide the code for creating and training a model, which would then be saved as an .h5 file. Please let me know if you'd like that.
