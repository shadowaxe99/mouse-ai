# Audio Samples

This directory contains audio samples that are used for testing the voice recognition functionality of the AI Mouse Controller application.

Each audio file is a .wav file that contains a single command that can be recognized by the application. The commands in these files are used to test the accuracy and performance of the voice recognition module.

Please do not delete or modify these files as they are essential for the testing process. If you need to add more test cases, please add new .wav files following the same format.
